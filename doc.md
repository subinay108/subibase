# Transaction

## What is a transaction?
A transaction is a unit of program execution that accesses and possibly updates various data items. Usually, a transaction is initiated by a user program written in a high-level data-manipulation language (typically SQL), or programming language (e.g., C++ or Java), with embedded database accesses in JDBC or ODBC.
